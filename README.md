# Internship_Demo
The demo include Devexpress, N-Layer Archtitecture, Image Classifaction App via Keras/Tensorflow and TCP/IP Connection.

This demo includes multi-connected database systems. Databases uses which are MsSQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird DB and In Memory. PostgreSQL DB is default database and In memory db
is like a tile db for against connection accident. This structure built via N-Layer Architecture, every stage has a layer and connect to others. Layers like Business Logic,
DataAccess Layer, Core Layer etc. We have two connection styles in the project. These are web service connection and TCP-IP connection. Web API will connect WinForm and we are 
thinking to connect with native devices in the future. Project is connecting to Deep Learning Model using TCP-IP connection. Project has client-side code for TCP-IP, server 
code belongs to Python Deep Learning model. Python code is in the my profile like this. Unlike my other project, I will write Unit test on my methods. I think to do it like
template project for my future project.
